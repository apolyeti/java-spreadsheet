# java-spreadsheet
- A simple spreadsheet application written in Java. Made for a school project.
- Entire spreadsheet is printed into the terminal.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations, cell references, and cell ranges.
- Syntax is highly sensitive, so be careful when entering expressions. (like even an extra space ruins it. sorry i really hate scanner) 
- Can save and load spreadsheets from a text file. (example.txt file for reference)

```bash
java VisiCalc.java
```
